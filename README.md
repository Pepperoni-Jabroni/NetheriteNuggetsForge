# Netherite Nuggets Mod

**Forge Version**
[Looking for the Fabric version?](https://github.com/Pepperoni-Jabroni/NetheriteNuggetsFabric)

A Minecraft mod which adds Netherite Nuggets for repairing Netherite gear.

Ever had the feeling that spending Netherite Ingots on repairs for Netherite Tools or Armor is just too expensive? Here's your solution! This is a very simple mod which adds a single new item: the Netherite Nugget. These Nuggets replace Ingots in Anvils as the repair item for Netherite gear. 

As you've guessed, crafting recipes are:
   - 1 Netherite Ingot => 9 Netherite Nuggets
   - 9 Netherite Nuggets => 1 Netherite Ingot

Yes... Go ahead and throw them into the fire... They won't burn.

**New feature**: Tired of those Piglin Brutes being tough to kill and unrewarding to loot? This mod also gives Piglin Brutes a 50% chance to drop a single Netherite Nugget on death. The chance is changeable with a Config in your /config/ folder, from 0% to 100%.
